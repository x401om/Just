For a long time the biggest thing you could name out of the country was Atlassian. Now other startups are joining the roster, and VC investment is ticking up.</p><p>The latest sign of this is the news that local VC AirTree Ventures​ has added Silicon Valley VC James Cameron, formerly of Accel Partners, to its team.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear to me that the Australian ecosystem has hit an inflection point&rdquo; he said in a statement. &ldquo;At Accel we&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to back some great Aussie and Kiwi founders who have been part of a new generation of world-class, globally-focused startups to emerge ​ from​ the region.&rdquo;</p><p>Joining him at AirTree is Julia French, former founder of C​overedCo,​ a marketing firm which gained a long reputation in the Valley. Julia has long had an association with the Australian ecosystem having helped support the US expansion and marketing efforts of a variety of Australian companies including Atlasssian.</p><p>There is around AUS$2 billion dollars in venture capital funding now <a href="http://www.startupdaily.net/2016/12/australian-startups-see-corporate-involvement-growing-international-investment-2017/">available</a> for Australian startups, with AirTree Ventures over the last few months <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/tie-my-series-a-down-sport/">closing</a> the country&rsquo;s largest-ever VC fund at AUS$250 million.</p>
